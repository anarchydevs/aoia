This light version of madCodeHookLib has exactly the same features as the full
version, but does not contain any sources. Furthermore the first instance of
madCodeHookLibLight, that gets loaded at the same time, pops up a little info
window for 1 second. If you don't like that, you can ask me for a modified
madCodeHookLibLight version, which doesn't show that box. Please use "noBox.htm"
for this purpose.
